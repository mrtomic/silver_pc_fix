Silver - PC fix for "Too many items in pie segment" error

Description :
 I used disassembler to change one assembly directive to bypass the code caussing this issue within the exe file.

1. Unpack this zip in game directory
2. Rename silver_patched.exe to the silver.exe and overwrite the original file.
3. Run the silver.exe :)
